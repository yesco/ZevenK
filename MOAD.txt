- computer display
- alive
- instant responsive
- augumented research center
- edit: copy-word repeat, mark, 
- file it: name
- beeps when doing
- name of file, date, time, who created, last written, last accessed
- copy statement, paragraph
- first line of each paragraph
- view control (first line/truncated)
- overview
- beep at each command
- numbered list

- undo (select version?)
- move line from place to other place (in shopping list)
- subcategory by indent
- view limit levels seen
- limited view (window)
- named location
- location by relative (word forward, p forward, letter forward, sentence forward)
- put link in document active name
- show/hide names
- graph: text, lines, text can be hyper link
- bip: each key
- beep: when thinking/doing command
- boop: error mode
- timesharing system
- 6 consoles
- 4th computer skillful
- how put it to work, organize
- jump on a link
- link have view specification
- view: small font, normal, big/presentation
- chain of view (A:sdfsdview)
- hyper-link click
- freeze statement (view)
- (show view under frozen/inline?)
- stack view following links!
- inline graph with labels
- (jsk: keep tree viewed when go up!)
- back
- cycle through views?
- where to focus to get the most return on next effort
- get the tools, make them, study them, by using it ourself (dogfood)
- NLS - oNLineSystem
- underline
- reveal part of graph by open part
- save the current view and make a link
- maximize current view
- go back to previous view/stack
- moved a marker ---- from one line to another (pick and place) to see where we are!
- control devices
- control dialogue
- control meta-language,

- control devices
- mouse (3 buttons), standard keyboard, keyset
- tracking spot (mouse cursor)
- move mouse for comfort can leave
- special keyboard keys
- 5 keys chording
- function to give last 6 characters typed from buffer
- single stroke change view parameters
- abbreviations to change view
- careful special langauge extreem precision of control functions and view
- outline graph (left to right)
     / x -  - y
     / z \
  a -| b \      /a
     \ c |- f -|/ b
                \ c
- update 15/s without using cpu (exernal box)
- round CRT! lol watched by camera
  (875 scanning line) 
- standard video microwave system
- 12 units
- wanted storage tube display
- 5500USD/unit
- cathod  camera, can shortterm storage (memory effect=avoid flickering!)
- use 3-4 more displays than otherwise

- control dialogue

- control meta-language,

- system guide file
- overlays each a block
- graph points to pages
- use file/graph like this to move around in code
- area where we leave notes for each other
- finite state machine
- following each key user typed to find code/function!
- text edit overlay
- two types of code
- special languages
- QMD language routine: move word
- content analyses language of string
- finds definition of word
- finds pointers to describe word
- another special lang built
- delimeter routine and reconstruct statement after edit has been done
- other portion of file is MOL
- machine oriented language
- high level, structure, if/while, but close to 940, registers
- helped to write kind of fast code we have to have, but also lots of flexibility
- phrase structureis matching using NLS itself
- navigating source code zoom in/out
- program organisational
- special purpose language
- special syntax
- linking structure
- one way we implemented these langagues
- 3meta = compiler compiler lanage
- all compilers written in 3meta
- system developement corporations
- all compilers in high level lang
- quickly modify in high level of
syntax and compilers and hardware
- system guide file: graph, unretrievable?, more notes about bugs
- view: blank lines off
- keeping track of who you are and what you doing all the time, on every statement keeps around this info, automated, who/when/what, can search w pattern
- you should see yourself with a 15 foot face
- anxious to talk aboiut languages, meta compilers and other games programmers like to play
- hierchical langauge (functions/command)
- whats a word,whats delete, special language define a word, sentence, 
- right concept level

- (59:14)
- move down mark
- how have we used it
- programming is an excellent
- structure your database
- tool getting around
- special lanauges
- name/labels/ used by compiler and navigation
- (edit a database)
- user documentation/user's guid
- one screen drawn in like 1s
- glossary
- freeze statement, move to top, what's a bug (displayed below), back
- what's a level
- frozen glossary stays
- nice to have documentation like this
- procedures for commands
- study modified papers
- printer design/printout format langauge (include data from named item?)
- double spaceing ect
- paper writing
- joint file usage
- message technique
- leave messges to eachother, can unfold
- pound sign between (@ lol!)
- wke@dce statement marked like that is message from him to me
- search all files for 'xyz' sort date
- look for message from '@dce' compilers
- compile it (view) only show those places (grep)
- turn off that filter
- about timesharing computers
- content analyser
- sometimes (hits the keys) ...
- have to use the keyboard, used to work with one hand...
- go back to file
- roles file, roes they are going to play
- (struggling with keyboard)
- different sessions
- duty roster
- code terms under it
- open house, etc, etc, (dates)
- content analyser
- what's the special pappern
- what's the people who are open house on tuesday evening
- compile it, list people
- view only only what category I was going to filter out

- markers
- put the tracker on any character enter that name (3 chars) instead of taking the char it takes the name, these markers, "OTE"
- execute compiler from here (markup!)
- put in any place in a file
- pattern matchers
- great power jumping around and study
- other things to show here
- (haha freeze here)
- same in design of hardware
- file specify wiring list for each and underlying is the equations
- can compile it
- collaborate (using joint file)
 
- go to an important sequence here
- combine mode between me and another terminal
- executive mode set to special level
- continue with NLS
- special command
- bill will you connect to me, what's terminal are you, (13)
- switch his display show my screen and he can point to it
- reserve right for me to edit
- "my bug is more powerful than yours"
- audio coupling and shared display
- I like to see you
- bring in camera from console, show in corner, resizable
- let's talk about information retrieval
- NLS complex data structures
- file classifying retrieval stuff
- two cursors
- retrieval is the main thing you do
- change view is doing retrieval
- categories: know dest, unknown
- two different problems
- direct: explicit, able to point at it, move it into view (jump to identity, name, link)
- indirect: implicit, using information that been stored in system where to go, memory of what you've been doing
- jump to the view I previously had
- jump, return
- jump ahead, move back down again
- jump refers to structure of file, successor of sentence, head of file
- other retrieval:
- indirect: able to describe it
- make file describe how you want to do a hard copy
- maybe you want roman page namers
- page formatting
- page numbering
- roman numerals
- here's the directive
- easy way to find exactly what you looking for
- direct: 
- best way to show is draw a picture
- keywords selected from list
- put list over there
- put it here and drags labelto place on screen
- select things from catalogue
- my own Dewie system #1.2.3
- draws line to keywords
- select keyword draw to it?
- select several keywords, special item put at head of list
- use other forms of retrieval
- file handling overview
- (keyword) description
- select keyword
- writes the word up here
- another command to accept it
- accept file control, file referencing
- I'm able to
- (somebody hung up on us)
- (Dough can I hear out)
- give some keywords greater weight
- describes what I'm after
- 1
- 2 will occour earlier in selection
- keyword execute, will reorder them
- I can use these to jump there to the utility file
- look at the next item
- continue to look at documentation, next item
- keyword is very powerful, should be a paper by itself, using weight to order
- results takes you off to actual source codes; name of places in files, and views you should use
- our commands fits with the structure we used
- we have a open house and you can come up and visit us
- push this button I get that response
- organization of hardware and software
- conventions for leaving messages, how to use the links, keywords, etc.
- new elements in system research
- concept
- procedures
- skills
- tools
- management system work
- we're taking some money
- to manage our 17 people
- arpa: computer network coming in about a year
- with 20 experiem
- hope to transmit across the countr
- 20kb/s
- <10ms
- I could be running a system in cambridge and get response on a CRT
- network information
- what protocols etc
- where can I find the paper that defines that system
- try to use our tools
- what's the product we're providing in our reasearch
- sample augmention system
- augument computer systems development
- to close:
- video control, systems
- worked very hard to make this work technically
- present at open house
- SRI supporting us
- Stewart Grant volunteered time
- projector for the large screen borrowed
- telephone company has done a great deal
- phone curcuits
- furniture company, we're interesting in walls, desks, they helped us designing a control console that I can control
- backed up by a tremendous team
- I owe them a lot
- and my wife and daughters because of what they put up with over this years
- dedicated to you
- thanks very much to come to the dedication cermonies
