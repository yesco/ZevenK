How many syllables in English?

Yoon Mi Oh's 2015 thesis (pages 44-45) provides estimates of the number of syllables for various languages, gathered by taking the 20,000 most frequent words in a corpus of each language and counting the different syllables that show up. Ordering them by increasing number of syllables:

Japanese: 643
Korean: 1104
Mandarin: 1274
Cantonese: 1298
Basque: 2082
Thai: 2438
Italian: 2729
Spanish: 2778
French: 2949
Turkish: 3260
Catalan: 3600
Serbian: 3831
Finnish: 3844
Hungarian: 4325
German: 5100
Vietnamese: 5156
English: 6949

For example, her count for English is 6,949 syllablesâ€”significantly less than the 15,000 you cited, because English has a lot of possible syllables, but most of them aren't actually used. ("Wug" and "strall" follow the rules of English syllable structure, but don't actually appear in any commonly-used words.)

Page 58 of the same thesis also gives the Shannon entropy of the syllable distribution in each language, which is an alternate way of measuring it; this takes into account the fact that English has a lot of syllables, but some of them are very rare (like the syllable "strengths", it only appears in a single word), while e.g. Japanese has fewer syllables, but they're more evenly distributed. By this measure, an English syllable in isolation conveys 9.51 bits of information on average, and a Mandarin syllable conveys 8.69 bits.
